# Synthetic Drift Scenarios

This repository contains a small Python utility that generates **fictional,
synthetic drift scenarios** for explanatory and illustrative purposes.

The outputs are intended to demonstrate *how* early warning signals
can emerge before lagging outcomes—not to represent real data.

All values are synthetic.
